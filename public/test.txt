I stumbled into freelancing thinking it would be smooth sailing.

I was wrong.

On February 20, 2024, I began learning React after spending six months getting comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

That felt like eons to some, but I was determined to build something worthwhile.

During my university days, I had a project and focused on the frontend alongside a friend. We got an excellent result of 16.25.

Meanwhile, I practiced on Frontend Mentor to sharpen my skills.

By June, I was diving into freelancing platforms like Fiverr and Khamsat, creating offers and building my portfolio.

But I faced a harsh reality—no response, just silence.

Frustration set in.

Everyone said summer was the time to capitalize on opportunities, but I felt stuck.

Then a realization hit me: opportunities don't just come; you have to actively pursue them.

I decided to return to selling fruits and veggies while continuing my studies.

Out of the blue, I received a call from a classmate looking for help with a React project.

It wasn’t a fortune, but it was crucial.

Working with him taught me invaluable lessons:

- Team communication saves time and energy.
- Good documentation is a must.
- Technical skills are just part of the puzzle; problem-solving is where the magic happens.
- Have faith; hard work paired with prayer pays off.
- University projects can connect you with future collaborators.
- The more you wish well for others, the more blessings you receive.

The most significant takeaway?

Opportunities don't seek you out. You have to take charge.

So, are you waiting for the right moment to act?
